# Soc-Gen-Complaint-Status-Tracking
Societe Generale (SocGen) is a French multinational banking and financial services company. With over 1,54,000 employees, based in 76 countries, they handle over 32 million clients throughout the world on a daily basis.  They provide services like retail banking, corporate and investment banking, asset management, portfolio management, insurance and other financial services.  While handling customer complaints, it is hard to track the status of the complaint. To automate this process, SocGen wants you to build a model that can automatically predict the complaint status (how the complaint was resolved) based on the complaint submitted by the consumer and other related meta-data.
